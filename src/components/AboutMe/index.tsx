          <p>
            Front-end developer, I love to learn and develop my skills every
            time I find something is interesting. Today I’m currently working
            actively on WebXR world but hope to expand my horizons to React
            development.
          </p>{' '}
          <p>
            I’m changing my carreer as graduated mechanical engineer to enter on
            the web development area. I’ve worked on big companies like Volvo
            Trucks and Renault as engineer, there I was able to improve my soft
            skills and team work.
